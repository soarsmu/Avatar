# Avatar

This replication package contains the source code for fine-tuning pre-trained models, model simplification and training, as well as all trained compressed models.



## Environment configuration

Please use a docker container with `PyTorch version >= 1.6`. For example,

```
docker run -it --gpus all -v <your repo path>:/workspace/Avatar --name <your container name> pytorch/pytorch:1.6.0-cuda10.1-cudnn7-devel
```

Which version of PyTorch should be used may be related to the version of cuda on your machine, please check carefully. Note that you can set `--cpus=<num>` to limit the used cpus in testing inference latency.

Then, please install some necessary libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
